**zombiCody** comes to life from the premise that developing, at an early age, the skills of critical thinking, destructuring problems, knowing how to face them and following a logical process is crucial.

And from there, **zombiCody** is born.

# What is zombiCody?

**zombiCody** is an educational platform where our main objective is to help children develop the skills of problem solution, logic and critical thinking. This is achieved by interactive courses that children can take in our platform; courses that are of different subjects.

# How does zombiCody work?

All of our courses are free. They are from different subjects and present to our users different interactive questions with a multiple option answer. Everytime a user answers, the platform will give immediate feedback, letting them know if the answer was correct or incorrect.

The platform will keep track of the correct questions that our user has answered and when specific milestones are achieved, they will earn an achievement that will be displayed in their user dashboard.

Each course can be taken at any given time and if you start one, you can take another one. Also, if you have not answered a question or don‚Äôt want to answer it at the moment, you can skip that question. We do not lock the content based on progress; everything is accessible right from the start.

# Type of users

There are three type of users:
Student, Father and Teacher.

Students and Fathers are our regular users. The first ones can access the platform and take any course they want. Fathers can also do this and activate their children accounts via the mail the platform sends them if the user is under age.

Teachers, on the other hand, have the same access as our other users and can also add their own curses; this means that they can create a title for the course, a subject, questions, select the correct answer and add images as a support.
